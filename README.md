# LAB | Express roles


## Introduction

You are asked to create **a full learning platform** covering not only the related CRUDS but adding an extra security layer through sessions and roles.

As the Ironhack Student Portal is, **all the routes from this platform will also be protected** - except the homepage, the login and the signup ones to allow users to authenticate. 

Any other route should be private, and any attempt to access without being logged must be rejected. 

Â¡Fuegote! ðŸ”¥


## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

You are provided an Ironlauncher with the full auth system implemented: setup, routes and views both for signup, login and logout. Check them out before starting!



## Iteration #1: Allow logged students to see other students's profiles

Our students want to check other students's profiles. Go!

**Tasks:**

- Complete the User model to handle roles, allowing 4 different roles: **STUDENT**, **DEV**, **TA** and **PM**. Set **STUDENT** as the default one. 
- Create some random students (this means users with the STUDENT role) using the signup form, so you can test your development in the best conditions!
- Create a `/students` endpoint listing all current students from the plaform.
- Include a _View student profile_ button for each student on the list. That button should take the user to a `/students/:id` URL, where you should render a nice profile page with the info from the student that matched with the ID on the URL.
- Prevent access to these routes for any non logged visitor.



## Iteration #2: Grant specific privileges to the Program Manager

There will be only one user with **PM** role. That user should be able not only to access the platform, but to edit or remove any of the current students.


**Tasks:**

- Use Mongo Compass to manually set the **PM** role to one of your users, named Victor.
- This user will be able to see a _Delete student_ and _Edit student_ buttons on each student profile. 
- Develop the needed routing system and views to archive this two goals.
- Avoid any other user except **PM** to see these extra buttons, access the routes or perform any of delete nor edit actions.


## Iteration #3: PM role handling 

The Program Manager can appoint any user as a Developer or a TA. 


**Tasks:**

- Allow our **PM** to update through the application any student role to 'DEV' or 'TA'.
- Avoid any other user except **PM** to archive this.

:bulb: __tip__: a couple of buttons on each student profile would do the thing! _Mark as Developer_ and _Mark as TA_. Remember: only our PM would be able to see those!


## Iteration #4: User profile editing

At this point only our PM is allowed to edit student's profiles. Develop the system to allow each student to edit their own profile.


**Tasks:**

- Create the system that would allow each student to edit _their own profile_.
- Avoid any student to edit other student's profile (except our Program Manager, of course!)




## Bonus: Course creation

We have student already defined, so our next step is to be able to create our content. An Ironhack platform without learning units is nothing!

The TAs will have the responsibility to create courses, so you need to create the routes and views to allow them create courses. **The courses can be created just by TAs**. The course model is already created for you.

**Tasks:**

- Create a CRUD to allow the TAs add/list/update/remove courses from the platform.
- The routes need to be protected, and the TA role will be the only one with this permission being granted.

## Bonus: Plaform extras

There are some details to accomplish on your application in order to archive a super proffessional platform:

- Integrate form validation in order to:
  - Ensure all fields from all forms are filled before submitting to the database.
  - Signup: avoid weak passwords. 8 characters as minimum length, one number required.
- Add a security layer on the student profile and course details routes, both containing an ID on the URL:
  - Avoid your application to crash when requested ID does not match the Mongoose ID format.
  - Avoid your application to crash when requested ID does not retrieve any results from the database.
- Allow student assist to any course they want:
  - Include a "Join course" button on every course to add that student to the `students` field from the course model.
  - Render the list of student assistants on every the course view.

Happy coding! :heart:
